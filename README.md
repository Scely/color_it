# Color-it challenge

## Prerequisites
Install Python 3.10. That's it.

## How to run my code

At main.py file level:
```
python main.py -i <your_input_csv_file_path> -o <your_output_csv_file_path>
```

If your input csv file is named `input.csv` and is located next to `main.py`:
```
python main.py -o <your_output_csv_file_path>
```
And if you are expected a csv file named `output.csv`:

```
python main.py
```
